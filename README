# My Vim config.

## Setup

Simply check this out to `$HOME/.vim`. Or copy and paste:

    git clone https://github.com/MrException/vim.git ~/.vim

Then run the `setup.sh` script:

    cd ~/.vim && bash setup.sh

## What it does

This setup script is pretty simple. What it does:
- Gets Vundle and puts it in the `~/.vim/bundle` directory
- Creates some empty folders needed for my config: `swap`, `backup`, and `undo` in your `~/.vim/` folder
- Starts vim and runs `:BundleInstall` to install all the plugins managed by Vundle

## Required

This config works best with some things set up:
- vim 7.4
- vim built with python support
- vim built with lua support
- python installed
- BeautifulSoup python lib (for JSON and XML pretting printing)
- ctags installed
