My Vim config.

Simply check this out and rename the directory to $HOME/.vim
Then copy the vim-init file to $HOME/.vimrc
Next get Vundle and put it in the bundle directory.
Open Vim and run :BundleInstall to install all the vundle stuff. Restart and you
are good to go!

This expects you to have some things installed:
-vim with python support
-python with BeautifulSoup
-sed
-ack
-ctags
