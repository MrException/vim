My Vim config.

Simply check this out and rename the directory to $HOME/.vim
Then copy the vim-init file to $HOME/.vimrc
Next get Vundle and put it in the bundle directory.

Open Vim and run :BundleInstall to install all the vundle stuff. Restart and you
are good to go! Or use: vim +BundleInstall +qall

This expects you to have some things installed:
-vim with python support
-python
-BeautifulSoup python lib (for JSON and XML pretting printing)
-sed
-ack
-ctags
